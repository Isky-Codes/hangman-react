# Hangman Game using REACT

A repository to hold a simple hangman game using a few basic react concepts that I have learned. In this game, the user will click on certain letters to guess the random word generated in six tries. For each incorrect guess, a figure is "drawn" indicating the number of hanged man and once the image is fully drawn the game is lost unless the players is able to guess the word before that happens.
